	abstract = {Comparisons between bin and bulk cloud microphysics schemes are conducted by simulating a heavy precipitation case using a bin microphysics scheme and four double-moment bulk microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. For this, we implemented an updated bin microphysics scheme in the WRF model. All of the microphysics schemes underestimate observed strong precipitation, but the bin microphysics scheme yields the result that is closest to observations. The differences among the schemes are more pronounced in terms of hydrometeor number concentration than in terms of hydrometeor mixing ratio. In this case, the bin scheme exhibits remarkably more latent heat release by deposition and riming than the bulk schemes. This causes stronger updrafts and more upward transport of water vapor, which leads to more deposition, and again, increases the latent heat release. An additional simulation using the bin scheme but excluding the riming of cloud droplets on ice crystals, which is not or poorly treated in the examined bulk schemes, shows that surface precipitation is slightly weakened and moved farther downwind compared to that of the control simulation. This implies that the more appropriate representation of microphysical processes in the bin microphysics scheme contributes to the more accurate prediction of precipitation in this case.},
