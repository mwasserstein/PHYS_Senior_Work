	abstract = {The Goddard microphysics was recently improved by adding a fourth ice class (frozen drops/hail). This new 4ICE scheme was developed and tested in the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model for an intense continental squall line and a moderate, less organized continental case. Simulated peak radar reflectivity profiles were improved in intensity and shape for both cases, as were the overall reflectivity probability distributions versus observations. In this study, the new Goddard 4ICE scheme is implemented into the regional-scale NASA Unified-Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) model, modified and evaluated for the same intense squall line, which occurred during the Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E). NU-WRF simulated radar reflectivities, total rainfall, propagation, and convective system structures using the 4ICE scheme modified herein agree as well as or significantly better with observations than the original 4ICE and two previous 3ICE (graupel or hail) versions of the Goddard microphysics. With the modified 4ICE, the bin microphysics-based rain evaporation correction improves propagation and in conjunction with eliminating the unrealistic dry collection of ice/snow by hail can replicate the erect, narrow, and intense convective cores. Revisions to the ice supersaturation, ice number concentration formula, and snow size mapping, including a new snow breakup effect, allow the modified 4ICE to produce a stronger, better organized system, more snow, and mimic the strong aggregation signature in the radar distributions. NU-WRF original 4ICE simulated radar reflectivity distributions are consistent with and generally superior to those using the GCE due to the less restrictive domain and lateral boundaries.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effect of hail on microphysical processes and precipitation. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Single-Moment 7-class Microphysics (WSM7) is developed by introducing the hail hydrometeor as an additional prognostic water substance within the WSM6 scheme, which are four-ice and three-ice schemes, respectively. In an idealized 2D squall case, the WSM7 scheme with hail tends to enhance the accretion rate of ice particles due to the faster sedimentation of hail than that of graupel in the WSM6 scheme. The amount of hail is largely compensated with the reduction of graupel, but its maximum at lower altitudes. Weakened accretion of graupel by snow at higher altitudes maintains the snow aloft, and increases of it at the mid-level. The reduced sum of graupel and hail at the melting level leads to a decrease in the mixing ratio of rain in the WSM7 experiment, which is compensated by falling hail. In 3D squall line experiments, the WSM7 scheme tends to enhance convective activities in the leading edge of the squall line, whereas the precipitation intensity in the trailing stratiform region decreases. This is due to the fact that the addition of hail plays a role in suppressing light precipitation and increasing heavy precipitation activities.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In the present study, three meteorological events of extreme deep moist convection, characteristic of south-eastern South America, are considered to conduct a systematic evaluation of the microphysical parameterizations available in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by undertaking a direct comparison between satellite-based simulated and observed microwave radiances. A research radiative transfer model, the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS), is coupled with the WRF model under three different microphysical parameterizations (WSM6, WDM6 and Thompson schemes). Microwave radiometry has shown a promising ability in the characterization of frozen hydrometeors. At high microwave frequencies, however, frozen hydrometeors significantly scatter radiation, and the relationship between radiation and hydrometeor populations becomes very complex. The main difficulty in microwave remote sensing of frozen hydrometeor characterization is correctly characterizing this scattering signal due to the complex and variable nature of the size, composition and shape of frozen hydrometeors. The present study further aims at improving the understanding of frozen hydrometeor optical properties characteristic of deep moist convection events in south-eastern South America. In the present study, bulk optical properties are computed by integrating the single-scattering properties of the Liu(2008) discrete dipole approximation (DDA) single-scattering database across the particle size distributions parameterized by the different WRF schemes in a consistent manner, introducing the equal mass approach. The equal mass approach consists of describing the optical properties of the WRF snow and graupel hydrometeors with the optical properties of habits in the DDA database whose dimensions might be different (Dmax′) but whose mass is conserved. The performance of the radiative transfer simulations is evaluated by comparing the simulations with the available coincident microwave observations up to 190 GHz (with observations from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMI/S)) using the χ2 test. Good agreement is obtained with all observations provided special care is taken to represent the scattering properties of the snow and graupel species.},

The same cloud-microphysical processes, long- and short-wave radiative transfer and land-surface processes are applied in all of the models to study explicit cloud-radiation and cloud-surface interactive processes in this multi-scale modeling system. This modeling system has been coupled with a multi-satellite simulator for comparison and validation with NASA high-resolution satellite data.  This paper reviews the development and presents some applications of the multi-scale modeling system, including results from using the multi-scale modeling system to study the interactions between clouds, precipitation, and aerosols. In addition, use of the multi-satellite simulator to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the model-simulated precipitation processes will be discussed as well as future model developments and applications.},
